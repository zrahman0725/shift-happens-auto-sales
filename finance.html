                        <li><strong>Establish a Budget:</strong> Know what you can afford, including monthly payments, insurance, and maintenance costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Understand Your Credit Score:</strong> A higher credit score means better loan terms. If your score is low, focus on improving it before buying.</li>
                        <li><strong>Choose Wisely:</strong> Opt for a reliable, fuel-efficient car that fits your needs and is within your budget.</li>

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Improve Your Debt-to-Income Ratio:</strong> Pay off debts to demonstrate financial stability.</li>
                        <li><strong>Shop Around:</strong> Different lenders offer different rates—explore your options before committing.</li>

                    <p>
                        Good credit is essential for securing the best financial opportunities. Here’s how to maintain it:
                    </p>

                        <li><strong>Timely Payments:</strong> Never miss a due date—set up automatic payments or reminders.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep Balances Low:</strong> Aim for a credit utilization rate below 30%.</li>
                        <li><strong>Diversify Credit Types:</strong> A mix of credit cards, loans, and other accounts shows lenders you can handle various obligations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitor Your Credit:</strong> Regularly check your credit report to ensure accuracy and catch fraud early.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Avoid closing old credit accounts unless absolutely necessary. Longer credit history boosts your score.
